# Anti Virtualization
The Library Can Detect Sandboxes and VM's and emulation, it detects sandboxes like: Qihoo360 Sandbox, Cuckoo Sandbox, Comodo Sandbox, Sandboxie Sandbox.
# Licensing
a class in MinegamesAntiCheat which can get Hardware ID and USB Hardware ID's.
# Communication
a class in MinegamesAntiCheat which can send messages to the server (encrypted or in plain text)
# Anti-Cheat
The Anti-Cheat can prevent cheats like cheat engine Speedhack, Direct3D Hook, preventing Injection (there's normal mode and aggerssive mode, the normal mode are the most stable but less protection and it can stop automated tools and script kiddies but for real protection you have to use aggressive and you have to use it right because it can crash your game or application)
and you can inject assembly code to function which you want to make it work in a different way, and you can change Memory Page Access, which you can restrict a Memory Page to prevent writing for it which can prevent memory modification cheats, but you have to be very carefull, and soon i will add something to prevent AimBots in games.
