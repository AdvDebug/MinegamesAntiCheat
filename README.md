# Anti Debugging
There's a lot of anti-debugging tricks here, like: CloseHandle (NtClose) Anti-Debug, CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent, Hide threads from debugger, etc....
# Anti Virtualization
The Library Can Detect Sandboxes and VM's and emulation, it detects sandboxes like: Qihoo360 Sandbox, Cuckoo Sandbox, Comodo Sandbox, Sandboxie Sandbox.
# Anti-Cheat
The Anti-Cheat can prevent cheats like cheat engine Speedhack, Direct3D Hook, preventing Injection (there's normal mode and aggerssive mode, the normal mode are the most stable)
and you can inject assembly code to function which you want to make it work in a different way, and you can change Memory Page Access, which you can restrict a Memory Page to prevent writing for it which can prevent memory modification hacks, but you have to be very carefull, and soon i will add something to prevent AimBots in games.
# Note
The Code won't get updated in the github page you will have to decompile it from latest releases.
